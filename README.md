How To Use:

Right Click on IAJ_Nuke V5.py and click "edit with ...." 

Scroll to the very botttom of the page and change where it says "TOKEN" and replace it with your bot token*.

Then Go back tp the top and find on line 23 and replace "ID" with your user ID.

Then save it and start it by double clicking the file (you need python installed, I would recommend python 3.8)

You will get a pop up saying remember to put the bot token in. Click Ok and then exit the window behind it.

When you are in the command prompt window wait a few seconds and text will apear on it. The bot has started.

Go to your test server and type "n/help". It should work!

Now you can play around with it.
